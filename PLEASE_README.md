# CMPS_121_Final

NOTE: Initially the app will crash on the first startup, but if you allow permissions and launch the app again, it will work properly.

NOTE2: Since some songs are hard coded into the application to test the acccess of the external storage, an sd card folder with the mp3 files is also provided. If you have files that exist on the current device and try to play them, the will not work unless they are changed within the code. (/Music/[SONGNAME].[EXTENSION] in the respective RingtoneService).

We are very sorry for the inconvenience. None of our group members were very familiar with using github to share project files, so we thought it would just be a much more efficient idea to share code and work together in person as a group. We do not have a github log to turn in because we are only using github as the method to turn in the final completed project. Again, we are sorry for any inconvenience that we may have caused you.
